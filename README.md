Your project aims to implement a pairs trading strategy using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on the paper you provided, here's a general approach and key insights we can derive to guide your project:

### Overview of Pairs Trading Strategy
- **Pairs Trading Concept**: It involves finding two stocks (or bonds in your case) exhibiting similar historical price behavior and betting on the convergence of their prices if they diverge. This approach is flexible and applicable across different asset classes【7†source】.

### Implementing POMDP for Pairs Trading
1. **Modeling the Problem**: Your strategy should be modeled as a POMDP, focusing on the interactions between the agent (trading strategy) and the environment (market conditions). TensorFlow is used for implementing the trading agent in the referenced paper【8†source】.

2. **Defining the Spread**: The fundamental aspect of pairs trading is the spread between the two assets. You'll need to define what constitutes 'long the spread' or 'short the spread' based on the expected increase or decrease in this spread【9†source】.

3. **Spread Definition Methods**: The paper discusses two methods - the Distance method and the Cointegration method. Each has its own way of defining the spread, either as a simple difference or a logarithmic relationship【10†source】.

4. **Trading Logic**: Once pairs are selected, a rule-based algorithm is used for entering and exiting positions. This involves checking the portfolio state and spread value at discrete time intervals and deciding actions based on predefined rules【11†source】.

### Reinforcement Learning (RL) Approach
1. **Policy Network with LSTM**: The paper suggests using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to model the policy for the trading agent. This setup helps in encoding the state of the environment and predicting the next action【12†source】.

2. **Agent's Decision-Making Process**: The agent trades one spread at a time, considering the level of the spread and the portfolio's value. The spread level's assessment can be subjective and based on the history of spread value【13†source】.

3. **LSTM Input and Extension with MLP**: The input to the LSTM includes the action taken at the previous time step, the current observation, and the hidden state. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) can be added after the LSTM to increase model complexity if necessary【14†source】.

4. **Reward Mechanism**: The immediate reward for the agent at each time step is the change in portfolio value. This incentivizes the agent to make profitable trades【15†source】.

5. **Policy Gradient Method**: The key learning method is the Policy Gradient (PG), where the policy is parameterized, and gradient ascent is used for updating parameters to find a better policy. The objective function is based on the expected return, and updates are made considering the agent's observed history in each episode【16†source】.

### Steps for Your Project
1. **Define Your Assets**: Choose the two bonds you want to trade.
2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather historical price data for your chosen bonds.
3. **Model Implementation**: Implement the POMDP model using TensorFlow, defining your spread and creating a rule-based algorithm for trade entries and exits.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Setup**: Develop the RL trading agent using LSTM and MLP, focusing on policy learning through the Policy Gradient method.
5. **Backtesting**: Thoroughly backtest your strategy over different market conditions to evaluate its performance.
6. **Visualization**: Develop visualizations to understand and present the trading actions and performance.

### Adapting the GitHub Repo
- Identify the core components of the repo that align with the POMDP model and RL approach outlined in the paper.
- Modify the code to fit your specific bond pairs and trading conditions.
- Ensure that the data preprocessing and input mechanisms are appropriate for your data set.
